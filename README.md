# Xojo IDE Communicator Client

> CLI client to communicate transparently with [Xojo IDE](https://www.xojo.com/) via [The Xojo IDE Communication Protocol v2](https://docs.xojo.com/UserGuide:IDE_Communicator).

This is a **Work in progress** CLI client written in [Go](https://golang.org/) that communicates withÂ Xojo IDE via a transparent API.
It takes care about the underlying implementation of [Unix IPC Socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) communication between the two parties involved in order to instrument Xojo's IDE to run, compile or test Xojo's applications.

## Build constraints
